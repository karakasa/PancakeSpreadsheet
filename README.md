# PancakeSpreadsheet
Grasshopper plugin for reading/writing xls(x) files without Excel, based on [NPOI](https://github.com/nissl-lab/npoi).

This is more stable and reliable than the COM approach and is cross-platform.

[See the project on Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/app/pancakespreadsheet?lang=en)

## Future plan
* Provides access to Google Spreadsheet, Airtable, etc. It can be done by implementing custom classes with NPOI interface `IWorkbook` to provide a unified access approach.
